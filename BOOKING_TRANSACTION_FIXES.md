# Booking & Transaction Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Added Transaction Status Field**
   - **File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`
   - **Changes:**
     - Added `status` field to `PlatformTransaction` model (PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILED)
     - Added `updatedAt` field for tracking changes
   - **Migration Required:** Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_transaction_status`

### 2. **Fixed Payment Creation**
   - **File:** `src/app/api/payments/create/route.ts`
   - **Changes:**
     - Set initial transaction status to `PENDING`
     - Fixed `relatedUser` to be the guest user (who makes the payment)

### 3. **Fixed Webhook to Create Bookings**
   - **File:** `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
   - **Changes:**

     - Improved email sending with better error handling
     - Added transaction status update to `SUCCESS` when payment succeeds
     - Updated failed payment handling to set status to `FAILED`
     - Enhanced logging for debugging

### 4. **Created Booking API Endpoints**
   - **Files:**
     - `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts` - GET all bookings (with role-based filtering)
     - `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts` - GET single booking by ID
   - **Features:**
     - Guest users see their own bookings
     - Host users see bookings for their tours
     - Admin users see all bookings
     - Supports pagination and status filtering
     - Includes related tour and user details

### 5. **Created Transaction History API**

     - `src/lib/services/transactionService.ts` - Transaction API client
   - **Features:**
     - Type-safe interfaces
     - Error handling
     - Support for filters (status, pagination)

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_transaction_status
   ```
   This will add the `status` and `updatedAt` fields to the `PlatformTransaction` table.

### 2. **Test Webhook in Production**
   - Ensure Stripe webhook URL is correctly configured
   - Test successful payment flow to verify:
     - Booking is created ‚úÖ
     - Transaction status updates to SUCCESS ‚úÖ
     - Emails are sent to guest and host ‚úÖ
     - Notifications are created ‚úÖ

### 3. **Integrate Frontend (Optional)**
   The services are ready to use. Example:
   ```typescript
   import { fetchBookings } from '@/lib/services/bookingService';
   import { fetchTransactions } from '@/lib/services/transactionService';
   
   // Fetch bookings
   const bookings = await fetchBookings({ page: 1, limit: 10, status: 'CONFIRMED' });
   
   // Fetch transactions
   const transactions = await fetchTransactions({ page: 1, limit: 10, status: 'SUCCESS' });
   ```

## üêõ Known Issues & Notes

### Webhook Not Working Locally?
   - **Issue:** Stripe webhooks require a public URL
   - **Solution:** Use Stripe CLI for local development:
     ```bash
     stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
     ```
   - Or use a tunneling service like ngrok

### Email Not Sending?
   - Check `.env.local` has correct email credentials:
     ```env
     EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
     EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
     ```
   - Check server logs for email errors
   - Emails are sent asynchronously and won't block the webhook

### Transaction Status Not Updating?
   - Ensure webhook is receiving events from Stripe
   - Check server logs for webhook processing
   - Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly

## üìä Transaction Status Values

- **PENDING**: Payment created but not yet processed
- **SUCCESS**: Payment completed successfully, booking created
- **FAILED**: Payment failed or was declined

## üîó API Endpoints

### Bookings
- `GET /api/bookings` - Get all bookings (role-based)
  - Query params: `page`, `limit`, `status`
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Get single booking

### Transactions
- `GET /api/transactions` - Get all transactions (role-based)
  - Query params: `page`, `limit`, `status`, `type`
- `GET /api/payments/guest/transactions` - Guest-specific formatted transactions
  - Query params: `page`, `pageSize`

## ‚ú® Summary

- ‚úÖ Transaction status field added
- ‚úÖ Booking creation in webhook fixed
- ‚úÖ Email sending improved
- ‚úÖ Booking API endpoints created
