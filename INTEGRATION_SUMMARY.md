# Booking & Transaction Integration Summary

## ✅ Completed Integration

### 1. **Bookings Page Integration**
   - **File:** `src/app/dashboard/(guest)/my-bookings/page.tsx`
   - **Changes:**
     - Replaced mock data with real API calls using `fetchBookings` from `@/lib/services/bookingService`
     - Added loading and error states
     - Updated filter buttons to match API status values (PENDING, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
     - Added search functionality to filter bookings by tour title, location, or booking ID
     - Displays real booking data including:
       - Tour details (title, location, images)
       - Booking details (amount, participants, scheduled date)
       - Host information
       - Booking status

### 2. **Transaction API Integration**
   - **File:** `src/lib/api/payment-api.ts`
   - **Changes:**
     - Updated `transformTransaction` function to properly map API status values
     - Status mapping:
       - `SUCCESS` → `completed`
       - `PENDING` → `pending`
       - `FAILED` → `failed`
     - Added null safety checks for optional fields
     - The existing payment store and GuestPayment component already use this API

### 3. **Transaction History Component**
   - **Component:** `src/components/dashboard/payment/transaction-history.tsx`
   - **Status:** Already integrated and working
   - Uses the payment store which fetches from `/api/payments/guest/transactions`
   - Displays transaction status, amount, date, experience, and host information

## 📋 API Endpoints Being Used

### Bookings
- **GET** `/api/bookings`
  - Query params: `page`, `limit`, `status`
  - Returns bookings with tour and user details
  - Role-based filtering (Guest sees their own, Host sees their tours, Admin sees all)

### Transactions
- **GET** `/api/payments/guest/transactions`
  - Query params: `page`, `pageSize`
  - Returns formatted transaction history for guests
  - Includes tour details and host information

## 🎯 How It Works

### Bookings Flow
1. User navigates to `/dashboard/my-bookings`
2. Component fetches bookings on mount using `fetchBookings()` service
3. Filter buttons change the `activeFilter` state (PENDING, CONFIRMED, etc.)
4. When filter changes, `useEffect` triggers new API call with status filter
5. Search query filters the results client-side
6. Displays bookings with all relevant information

### Transactions Flow
1. Payment page loads and calls `initializePaymentData()`
2. This fetches both summary and transactions in parallel
3. Transactions are transformed and stored in payment store
4. `TransactionHistory` component displays the data
5. Status is properly mapped from API format to UI format
